# Lists
If you want to display lists in a way that is more visually distinctive than
the standard <ol> and <ul>, Vanilla brochure theme has 3 list styles at your
disposal.


## Ticked List

The color of the tick icon is set by the `$color-accent` variable in `_settings.scss`.

## Split List

If you wish to split the items in a list into two columns above `$breakpoint-medium`, you can do so by adding the class `is-split` to the list element.

## Stepped List

Stepped list should be used for step by step instructions. This pattern is best
used on a grey strip as the description sections are displayed in a white box.
